Initial Demo Version of the game is now released!

# Overview
This is a simple solar system game where you can fly and explore a virtual solar system in your spaceship. Planets and orbits are realistically created and designed.

# Features:
* Ability to fly around a solar system with fully working gravity obeying newton's universal laws of gravitation
* Ability to land on Celestial Bodies

# How to install
* First download the game files for windows in the releases section on GitHub (https://github.com/Thesupernile/Solar-System-Game/releases)
* Next, unzip the folder and open it
* Click on the file labelled solar system game to play
* Enjoy :)

# How to play
* To move the camera, use the mouse to point the direction that you want to turn (eg. move your mouse right to turn right or up to turn upwards)
* To move the player, hold w to move forwards, s to move backwards, a to move leftwards, d to move rightwards, q to move upwards and e to move downwards
* When you get close to a planet, the camera will snap downwards to the ground, making it easier for you to land on the planet

# Future Plans
* Adding ability to leave spaceship to explore the planet more easily
* Adding space stations where you can refuel and fix your spaceship (and thus adding fuel and health bars)
* Adding navigation aids to help you fly to the games planets more easily
